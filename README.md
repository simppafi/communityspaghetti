Public ghit for creating the ugliest and most bizarre piece of shiz ever written.

Point is to demonstrate all the ways not to write code.

If you wish to participate to this experiment please tweet to <b>@simppafi</b> and I'll add you.

Rule 1:
spaghetti.js contains a method called spaghetti that returns its parameter as it was given.
so spaghetti("foo") should return "foo"

Rule 2:
Make this as complicated and confusing process as possible.

Coding task might sound simple at first, but I can assure you, it can be done in a very complicated fashion.
